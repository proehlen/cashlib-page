# cashlib-page

This repo is for the `cashlib` library GitHub page.

## Project setup

npm install
```

This project expects the following three files from the `cashlib` project to be available at the root of the public folder:

1. `docs.json`
2. `package.json`
3. `README.MD`

All three files are produced into the `docs` folder of the `cashlib` project by running `npm run docs`.  For local development/testing they can be manually copied into this project's `/public` folder.
